# Frackman
C++ Game made in UCLA CS32, Winter 2016

Rules:

As the Frackman, your goal is to find the hidden oil barrels in the  field of each level. However, protestors who are against your trying to find oil will be trying to stop you (and some of them are pretty hardcore)! You can defend yourself from these protestors by shooting them with a squirt gun or by distracting them with pieces of gold you find in the oil field. Occasionally, power ups will spawn in the field - such as more water for your squirt gun or a sonar kit to help you find hidden items! Once you find all the oil barrels in a level, you advance to the next level which increases in difficulty. Good luck fracking!

Requires XQuartz to play on MacOS.
